# Basic Express API

## What it is

It's a simple API that handles with users stuff (like creating, deleting or updating info) and also deals with sessions by using JWT as its authentication method.

## How it's made

This API is entirely developed using Node.js and Express. Maybe I will do an AdonisJs version of it in the future, but I rather learn how to do that, at first, by using Express, once it doesn't solve the whole problem for me.
